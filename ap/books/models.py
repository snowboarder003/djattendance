""" BOOKS models.py

The BOOKS module is a utility module that is used by other modules such as
class syllabus and life-studies. It is used primarily to represent ministry
books, but can be adapted for any book, such as non-LSM books in the library.

Data Models:
    - Book: a single title
    - Collection: a series of books, such as the Life-study
    - Publisher: a book publisher, such as LSM or A&C Press
